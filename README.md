This project was created to satisfy the project-1 requirements of the [Udactiy Data Scientist](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) course.
It contains analysis of Seattle AirBnB data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). This data was analyzed to find the most effective way for lister on AirBnB to select a price for their listing. The conclusion of the project was that a linear model was not sufficient to find all of the relationships between the data. 

The project used *numpy* and *pandas* for collection and cleaning and analysis of the data, as well as *matplotlib* and *seaborn* for visualizations.
